# tic-tac-game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple 3×3 grid game where two players, X and O, take turns marking the cells. The goal is to place three marks in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. In JavaScript, the game is built using a 9-cell board, click events for each cell, logic to check win/draw conditions, and a reset option to play again.
